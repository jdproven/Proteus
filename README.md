# Proteus

Each file in this repo is a project I have worked on within about the last year.  I believe they are reflective of my current coding capabilities.  Brief descriptions of each project are listed in chronological order of completion and are as follows:

Assgn1_aStar:

This project contains one file called Assgn1_astar.java that computes the lowest "cost" of a pixel-by-pixel traversal of an image from pixel (100,100) to pixel (400,400) where the "cost" of moving from pixel a to pixel b is the grayscale of pixel b (thus, darker pixels are considered to be lower cost).  The project also contains two graphical representations; the first is terrain.png which shows the image before analyzation, and the second is path.png which shows the optimal path outlined in red.  The green rings represent equal-cost paths.
